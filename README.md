<br>
<p>I'm Electrical & Electronics Engineer. But I'm interested in embedded systems programming and C++ programming language.</p>

<p>In Summer of 2022, I participated TEKNOFEST Model Satellite Competition which is organized in TÜRKİYE and I launched the satellite together with me to the space. It's only joke, was only launched satellite! I programmed "Flight Control Systems & Ground Station Interface".</p>

<p>And I built "Steel White House" with my family. It's not about computer or software. But It was very important for me because I was 20 years old when I built a house.<p>
